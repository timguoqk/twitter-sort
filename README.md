Twitter Travel Salesman
==========

Twitter Travel Salesman is an algorithm that takes advantage of the Twitter API.
You pass the TSP you would like to solve and it will tweet
a request asking for somebody to solve them. When someone replies with
a solution of the numbers, it will print them to the console 
and return.

Setup
-----
Ensure you have the `tweepy` module installed:

    pip install tweepy

Or clone from the Git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
    cd tweepy
    python setup.py install

Rename `settings_template.py` to `settings.py` and fill the API_KEY and
API_SECRET with your own key.
